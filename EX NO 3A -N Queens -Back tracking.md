# EX 3A N Queens Problem - Backtracking Approach.

## AIM:
To Write a Java program for N queens using backtracking approach.
You are given an integer N. For a given N x N chessboard, find a way to place 'N' queens such that no queen can attack any other queen on the chessboard.
A queen can be attacked when it lies in the same row, column, or the same diagonal as any of the other queens. You have to print one such configuration.

Note :

Get the input from the user for N . The value of N must be from 1 to 4

If solution exists Print a binary matrix as output that has 1s for the cells where queens are placed

If there is no solution to the problem  print  "Solution does not exist"

## Algorithm
1. Initialize an N × N chessboard with all elements as 0.
2. Place queens column by column starting from column 0.
3. For each column:
Try placing a queen in each row one by one.
Check safety using the isSafe() function:
No queen in the same row (left side).
No queen in the upper-left diagonal.
No queen in the lower-left diagonal.
4.  If a position is safe, place the queen (board[i][col] = 1) and recur for the next column.
5.  If placing in the current column fails, backtrack — remove the queen (board[i][col] = 0) and try next row.
6.  If all queens are placed successfully, print the board as a valid solution.
7.  If no configuration works, print “Solution does not exist.”
